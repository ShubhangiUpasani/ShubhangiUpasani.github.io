<div text-align="justify" style="margin-top:10px">I'm a second year Master's student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed my Bachelors in Technolgy (B.Tech) in Electronics and Communication engineering at Delhi Technological University, India in 2019.</div>
<div text-align="justify" style="margin-top:10px">My primary research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning. I'm keen to explore different problem spaces in vision and employ deep learning models to find creative solutions to them. I've been exploring my interests in 3D computer vision as well. I'm working as a research collaborator in Hays lab, Georgia Tech where I'm studying machine learning models to facilitate lane-graph inference by self-driving vehicles. It's my long-term objective to utilize the expertise I gain from my research endeavours for making AI-powered, embodied agents that are equipped to perceive and respond to their environments and perform lifesaving tasks.</div>
<div text-align="justify" style="margin-top:10px">Apart from this, I've had the fortune of interning at companies like Amazon, Western Digital (SankDisk) and Andritz Hydro which have given me a well-rounded understanding of software engineering. I particularly enjoy backend development through various cloud services and I'm always looking for avenues to satiate my hunger for the same.</div>
