<div text-align="justify">I'm a second year Master's student in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I completed my Bachelors in Technolgy (B.Tech) in Electronics and Communication engineering at Delhi Technological University, India in 2019.</div>
<div text-align="justify">My primary research interests lie at the intersection of computer vision and deep learning. I'm keen to explore different problem spaces in vision and employ deep learning models to find creative solutions to them. I've been exploring my interests in 3D computer vision as well. I'm working as a research collaborator in Hays lab, Georgia Tech where I'm working to make machine learning models for lane-graph inference by lifesaving, self-driving vehicles.</div>
<div text-align:"justify">I've had experience in software engineering too. I particularly enjoy backend software development. I've had the fortune of interning at <ul><li>Amazon, Seattle, USA</li><li>Western Digital (SankDisk), India</li></ul> </div>
