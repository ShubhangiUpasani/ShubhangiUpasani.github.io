  <h3><li>Facebook Habitat AI challenge</li></h3>
   
  <h3><li>Visual Question Answering</li></h3>
  Research and designed a VQA model that leverages both visual and textual cused to answer questions about an image. Used a novel fusion-based model along with       parallel and alternate co-attention models for visual question answering.
  <h3><li>Visual Relationship Detection</li></h3>
  Extracted visual relationships between objects in an image to get a sense of the overall scene semantics through few-shot learning approach and triplet loss.       Trained CNN models with bounding box masks for each positive and negative instance of a visual relationship along with glove embeddings for the relationship         predicate.  
  <h3><li>Semantic Segmentation on Antarctic Landsat-8 Imagery</li></h3>
  Extracted rock-outcrop through semantic segmentation of Landsat-8 satellite imagery using deep learning models to study the effects of global warming in             Antarctica. Carried out a comprehensive analysis of factors (sun elevation, cloud cover etc.) responsible for differentiation of ice from rock pixels.
  <h3><li>Genre-specifc Lyrics Generation</li></h3>
  Automated the process of generating lyrics specific to ten different genres from Million Songs dataset and developed machine learning models to predict their       popularity. Employed RNN model and different clustering techniques to achieve the objective. 
  <h3><li>Contextual Sentiment Analysis of Tweets</li></h3>
  
  <h3><li>Predicting Click Through Rate (CTR) of Online Advertisements</li></h3>
